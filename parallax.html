<p>Doing this assignment, I have learned  how to do Parallax Effect Photo. I picked a photo from Jordan Lake, because  there is a sail boat there and I think that moving sail boat is a great idea to  add a little bit movement to this picture. Using pen tool I outlined sailboat,  and added it to the new layer. Then I modified the layer, and removed outlined  figure from the picture. The next step was to create new  document with video dimension: 1920*1080px , and moved my layers on it. After  this, I convert every layer to the Smart Object, and created Timeline video  where zooming in and zooming out the layers, I transformed them. 
 I believe, that the movement, I added  to the photo is very organic and smooth. The sailboat is bigger on the  foreground, moving away, get smaller.
