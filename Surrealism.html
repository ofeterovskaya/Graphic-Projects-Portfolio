<p>For this  assignment I needed to pick at least three images and to create Dali-inspired  composition. I tried to apply all my photoshop skills I learned during this  semester so far. I picked a sky background, a clown from McDonalds, a tube, a  clock, and a cow. I used warp element to squeeze the tube into the clown's pocket,  applied mask to remove unnecessary tube's part,  changed tube's color and  added some color effects on it. Then, I also applied warp effect to squeeze the  cow from the tube. Then, I made some copies of the cow's layer and applied  different filters for each cow, adding blur effect for some of them, and  transforming and resizing them making flying effect. In addition, I made mask  layer for some cows and selected light lightning effect, so the cows look like  clouds. Finally, I picked perspective and warp effect for the clock, and using  mask changed the clock's color.</p>
<p>An Idea of this composition could be: &quot;While you are enjoying McDonalds, time flies, and more and more cows are flying away.&quot;</p>
