<p>For this assignment, I created a humorous e-Card using at least three RAW images that were provided, I used four. 
I put together two identical images <img src="IMG_0179.jpg" alt="background">. I put together two identical images and flip horizontally one of them, created the background for my composition.
</p>
<p>Then, I added photos of a "groom" <img src="IMG_0178.jpg" alt="groom">
Then, I added photos of a "bride" <img src="IMG_0174.jpg" alt="bride">
Then, I added  <img src="IMG_0173.jpg" alt="green"></p>
<p>I used masks to non-destructively remove the background. After resizing images and put them together, I changed the brightness, levels, and hue of several of the layers to make them look like whole picture. Additionally, I changed the curves, overall brightness and contrast of the composition. I added a warm photo filter to the composition to make warmer colors. Also, I used blur effect, to make cars on the background not in the focus, and I applied liquify filter to make "groom's" and "bride's" smiles</p>

<p>For the humor of this piece, I decided to do this couple of cars as a bride and groom for those, who are getting married in late age (as my grandmother, she got married at 74) she said: â€œit is never late"
